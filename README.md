# 📊 Value-at-Risk (VaR) Calculator

## 🎯 Project Overview
A sophisticated **quantitative risk management application** that calculates **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** for investment portfolios using multiple statistical methodologies.  
This professional-grade tool helps investors, portfolio managers, and financial analysts **quantify potential losses** their portfolios might face under normal market conditions — with institutional accuracy.

## 🔍 What is Value-at-Risk (VaR)?
Imagine you have ₹100,000 invested in stocks. VaR answers the question:  

> *"What's the maximum amount I might lose in the next 20 days if the market behaves normally?"*

If your VaR is ₹5,000, it means there’s only a 5% chance you’ll lose **more than ₹5,000** in those 20 days.

**Definition:**  
VaR is a statistical risk measure that quantifies the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval.  
It represents the threshold value such that the probability of portfolio loss exceeding this value is small (typically **1% or 5%**).

## 🚀 Key Features

### **Core VaR Methods**
- 📊 **Historical Simulation VaR** – Uses actual past returns to predict future risk.  
- 📐 **Parametric VaR** – Uses mathematical models assuming normal distribution.  
- 🎲 **Monte Carlo VaR** – Runs thousands of simulations to estimate risk.  

### **Advanced Analytics**
- **Component VaR** – Shows which assets contribute most to portfolio risk.  
- **Risk Decomposition** – Visual breakdown of risk sources.  
- **Correlation Analysis** – How assets move together.  
- **Performance Metrics** – Sharpe ratio, volatility, maximum drawdown.  

### **Professional Features**
- **Real-time Data** – Live feeds via Yahoo Finance API.  
- **Interactive Visualizations** – Dynamic charts & graphs.  
- **Multiple Weighting Schemes** – Equal weight, market cap, risk parity.  
- **Bootstrap Enhancement** – Improved accuracy through resampling.

| Term             | Simple Explanation | Expert Definition |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Portfolio**    | Your collection of stocks | A collection of investments held by an individual/institution |
| **Returns**      | Profit or loss made | Gain/loss over a period as a percentage |
| **Volatility**   | How much prices jump | Statistical measure of return dispersion |
| **Correlation**  | How two stocks move together | Statistical relationship between securities |
| **Confidence Level** | How sure we are about a prediction | Degree of certainty in a statistical conclusion |
| **Rolling Window** | Last X days of data | Moving subset of data for analysis |

📖 Usage Guide
Basic Usage (Beginner)
Enter Stock Symbols – Example: AAPL MSFT GOOG TSLA

Set Date Range – Select start and end dates.

Configure Parameters:

Rolling Window: e.g., 20 (monthly), 60 (quarterly)

Confidence Level: e.g., 95% or 99%

Portfolio Value: Total investment amount

Click “Calculate VaR” – Instant risk assessment.

Advanced Usage (Professional)

from portfolio_manager import PortfolioManager
from risk_calculator import RiskCalculator

# Create portfolio
portfolio = PortfolioManager(
    ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG'],
    start_date='2020-01-01',
    end_date='2024-01-01',
    portfolio_value=1_000_000
)

# Calculate risk metrics
risk_calc = RiskCalculator(portfolio, confidence_level=0.95, time_horizon=20)
results = risk_calc.calculate_all_var_methods()


📊 Understanding the Results
Historical VaR – Based on actual past performance.

Parametric VaR – Based on mathematical assumptions.

Monte Carlo VaR – Based on thousands of random simulations.

Key Metrics

Sharpe Ratio – Higher is better.

Maximum Drawdown – Largest peak-to-trough loss.

Volatility – Annualized standard deviation.
