🎯 Project Overview
A sophisticated quantitative risk management application that calculates Value-at-Risk (VaR) for investment portfolios using multiple statistical methodologies. This professional-grade tool helps investors, portfolio managers, and financial analysts quantify potential losses their portfolios might face under normal market conditions with institutional accuracy.
🔍 What is Value-at-Risk (VaR)?
Simple Explanation (Class 10 Level):
Imagine you have ₹100,000 invested in stocks. VaR answers the question: "What's the maximum amount I might lose in the next 20 days if the market behaves normally?" If your VaR is ₹5,000, it means there's only a 5% chance you'll lose more than ₹5,000 in those 20 days.
Expert Level:
VaR is a statistical risk measure that quantifies the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval. It represents the threshold value such that the probability of portfolio loss exceeding this value is small (typically 1% or 5%).
🚀 Key Features
Core VaR Methods

📊 Historical Simulation VaR: Uses actual past returns to predict future risk
📐 Parametric VaR: Uses mathematical models assuming normal distribution
🎲 Monte Carlo VaR: Runs thousands of simulations to estimate risk

Advanced Analytics

Component VaR: Shows which stocks contribute most to portfolio risk
Risk Decomposition: Visual breakdown of risk sources
Correlation Analysis: Shows how stocks move together
Performance Metrics: Sharpe ratio, volatility, maximum drawdown

Professional Features

Real-time Data: Live stock price feeds via Yahoo Finance
Interactive Visualizations: Dynamic charts and graphs
Multiple Weighting Schemes: Equal weight, market cap, risk parity
Bootstrap Enhancement: Improved accuracy through resampling

📚 Financial Concepts Explained
1. Portfolio

Simple: A collection of different stocks you own
Expert: A collection of financial investments held by an individual or institution

2. Returns

Simple: How much money you made or lost on an investment
Expert: The gain or loss on an investment over a specified period, expressed as a percentage

3. Volatility

Simple: How much a stock price jumps up and down
Expert: A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index

4. Correlation

Simple: How two stocks tend to move together (up or down at the same time)
Expert: A statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other

5. Confidence Level

Simple: How sure we are about our prediction (95% = very confident)
Expert: The degree of certainty in a statistical conclusion

6. Rolling Window

Simple: Looking at the last X days of data to make predictions
Expert: A technique using a fixed-size subset of data that moves through the dataset

Advanced Usage (Professional Level)
python# Programmatic usage example
from portfolio_manager import PortfolioManager
from risk_calculator import RiskCalculator

# Create portfolio
portfolio = PortfolioManager(['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG'], 
                           start_date='2020-01-01', 
                           end_date='2024-01-01', 
                           portfolio_value=1000000)

# Calculate comprehensive risk metrics
risk_calc = RiskCalculator(portfolio, confidence_level=0.95, time_horizon=20)
results = risk_calc.calculate_all_var_methods()
